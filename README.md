Analysis of the Coursera course dataset<br>
For this work we will use Coursera course dataset downloaded from here:<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset . <br>
  The aim of this analysis is to find what courses are most popular among various groups of people, what subject is most popular and find more interesting insights as well as to visualize the results to make the data more ease to understand. The objective is to practice performing basic EDA, practice reading data, performing queries and filtering data using Pandas, also providing graphical visuals using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.<br>
  In this work, data cleaning, data analysis are provided. The data set outliers are not excluded, since these are a very important piece of information.<br>
Main questions asked to determine the most popular course provided by the platform:<br>
* How courses are spread according course ratings;<br>
* How courses rating correlate with student participation;<br> 
* How many courses are there based on course difficulty;<br>
* How course ratings depend on complexity;<br>
* How students are distributed based on course complexity;<br>
* What are most popular words in the courses title.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
  The aim of this thesis was to determine which courses are the most popular on Coursera. The following conclusions can be drawn from the questions answered:
* The most popular course rating is 4.8
* The rating does not correlate with attendance. Although the number of students shows that both the ranking and the number of students in the ranking should have a correlation. This is probably not the case because ranking is not compulsory and not every student does it.
* Most courses are designed for Beginner level and the courses at this level have the highest number of visitors.
* Analysing the most popular words in the course titles, we can conclude that the most popular courses are in the fields of data , management and business.
